# Global News Roundup: Ceasefires, Wildlife, and Political Races

**International Tensions and a Fragile Ceasefire**

A tense ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding, though US President Donald Trump has accused both sides of violations and urged them to "calm down."  The situation remains precarious, with the potential for renewed conflict a significant concern.  This follows an earlier Iranian attack on a US airbase in Qatar and the reported killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist in an Israeli strike.  The effectiveness of any ceasefire and the long-term implications for regional stability remain uncertain.

**Wildlife News: Loss and Controversy**

The death of Arrowhead, a renowned crocodile-hunting tigress in India's Ranthambore National Park, has saddened wildlife enthusiasts.  Meanwhile, a New Zealand advertisement promoting awareness of herpes has won a top prize at the Cannes Lions awards for its efforts to destigmatize the infection.  In a separate incident, bears raided a honey store after escaping from a wildlife park, prompting an evacuation.

**Politics and Elections**

In the US, the race for New York City mayor is heating up, with a left-wing outsider challenging a potential comeback from Andrew Cuomo.  This race is seen as potentially significant for the Democratic party's national strategy as it prepares to face Donald Trump.  In the UK, a legal claim has been filed by hundreds of veterans alleging they suffered hearing loss due to faulty earplugs provided by the military.
